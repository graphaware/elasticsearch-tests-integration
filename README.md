Testing Support for Elasticsearch Integrations
==============================================

Provides the ability to test against Elasticsearch in the presence of potential dependency version clashes. A classic example
 are different versions of Lucene when running Neo4j and Elasticsearch in the same JVM.

This project starts Elasticsearch using a different classloader, hence alleviating the issue.

For Elasticsearch 2.3.0+, use

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.graphaware.integration.es</groupId>
    <artifactId>elasticsearch-tests-integration</artifactId>
    <version>2.3.0.1</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

For Elasticsearch 2.2.0+, use

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.graphaware.integration.es</groupId>
    <artifactId>elasticsearch-tests-integration</artifactId>
    <version>2.2.0.1</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```
